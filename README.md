# Planet Escape

## Intoduction

This project is currently a work in progress. I want to build a gameplay cinematic where all the characters (agents) are controlled by neural networks trained through reinforcement learning (RL). The initial conditions of the scene are randomized, therefore, each time, a unique experience unfolds. All the agents try to fulfill their own objective (by maximizing their reward function).
